                  It is critically important that small businesses understand
                  and use financial statements. While most businesses do create
                  financial statements in order to prepare tax returns or to
                  file loan applications, the real benefit financial statements
                  can provide is that they can help you run your business
                  better. Preparing financial statements that are useful to your
                  management team is one of the key CFO Services PKB Accounting
                  Services provides.

                  More important than understanding how your business has
                  performed in the past is having a firm grasp on how your
                  business is likely to perform in the future. In fact, the main
                  reason to think about what has happened in the past is to gain
                  insights as to what is likely to happen going forward. As your
                  part-time CFO, PKB Accounting Services will assist you with
                  forecasting both revenues and expenses. We could not claim to

                  </strong>
                  Budgeting can be one of the most difficult tasks your
                  management team has to perform. Unfortunately, it also one of
                  the most important. Inaccurate budgeting can lead to harmful

                  budgeting, and so we work with all of our customers to make
                  sure they are considering all the possibilities that can
                  effect both revenue and expenses, and that they are budgeting
                  accordingly
